Conclusions:
- Python's numpy uses optimized BLAS libraries, making sequential very fast
- Multiprocessing overhead dominates for small/medium matrices
- Real MPI implementation would show better scaling characteristics
- GPU acceleration (OpenCL) would provide significant speedup for large matrices
